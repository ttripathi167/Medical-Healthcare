P.S.: 
 - Interesting titbit: **AI is better than many dermatologists at diagnosing skin cancer.**  In a study published in the leading cancer journal  - **Annals of Oncology** 
 	- Dermatologists were **only 86.6% accurate** at diagnosing skin cancer, 
	- while the computer was able to diagnose issues with a **95% accuracy**. It was also quoted in **Fortune magazine published in Y2018**.
